# sentiment analysis
Python code to develop a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)


In this code, you'll need to replace the texts and labels with your own dataset. Additionally, you can modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, and preprocessing steps as needed. Remember to install the required libraries (Keras, scikit-learn) if you haven't already.

The code trains an RNN model on the dataset, evaluates its performance on a test set, and then provides a user-friendly interface to analyze the sentiment of user-provided text input.
